# cs466_s17
WSU CS466, Spring semister 2017
===============================

For the semister I will be providing lab information via this git-hub link.

When I have more files or updates available I'll let everyone know.  It's a good
idea to pull updates before you start developing.

may want to fork this repo into your own private space.  As students you all have
access to free private github accounts.

I'll handout instructions on Thursday.

Assignments and labs will be turned in via Blackboard.

The compilers for this course are available at: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded but should be available on the lab Linux environment.
